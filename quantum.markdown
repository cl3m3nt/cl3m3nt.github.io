Quantum Computing starts with Qbits, the basic information units that relies on Quantum Mechanics properties, superposition and entanglement. While Quantum Computers are still on their way, it might be worth exploring a technology that could exceed classic computers processing capabilities by multiple orders of magnitude.

Ready to use python libraries are already available to get started with Quantum Circuits.

IBM has made Qiskit an open source library with documentation available at:
[qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)

Google has made Cirq for Quantum Circuit and TensorFlow Quantum for hybrid quantum-classical ML models.
Documentation can be found at: 
[TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) and [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq)
