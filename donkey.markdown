Donkey car is an [open source](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar) self driving platform for small scale car. I am building my own car for fun and practice of robotics and artificial intelligence. At the end of the process, you get Autonomous Driving in your living room, pretty cool !

You can find Donkey Car official web site at:

You can find instructions to build your own at:
[documentation](http://docs.donkeycar.com/)
